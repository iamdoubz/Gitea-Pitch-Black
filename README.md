# Gitea-Pitch-Black

Pitch black theme for Gitea versions 1.14 through 1.16

## Use cases

1. Use `theme-pitchblack.less` to create theme at compile time. Drop this file into gitea/web_src/less/themes and compile Gitea!
2. Use `theme-pitchblack.css` for a de-minified version of the css that can easily be edited for personal use. Just drop this file into `/path/to/gitea/custom/public/css` and add the new [theme into your app.ini](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/config-cheat-sheet/#ui-ui) file.
3. Use `theme-pitchblack.less` to compile theme using another method like [clessc](https://github.com/iamdoubz/Gitea-Pitch-Black/issues/6), you will also need the [dark.less chroma dependency](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/tree/main/web_src/less/chroma/dark.less) directly from the Gitea repo.
